# GoVAULT Analysis Required

## Current Status
I need to complete the analysis phase before implementing any code changes.

## Required Information

### 1. Complete PDF Review
The provided PDF shows only 251 lines out of 591 total lines. I need access to the remaining content to understand:
- Complete feature specifications
- All user interface requirements  
- Technical implementation details
- Integration requirements

### 2. Existing Codebase Access
The user referenced an existing GitHub repository: https://github.com/b33kman/govault.git

Since I cannot directly clone repositories, please provide:
- All existing source code files
- Current project structure
- Package/dependency files
- Configuration files
- Any existing documentation

### 3. Analysis Objectives
Once I have access to both the complete requirements and existing code, I will:
- Assess current implementation status
- Identify completed vs missing features
- Determine what needs to be built/modified
- Provide accurate implementation plan
- Ensure no duplicate work is performed

## Next Steps
Please provide:
1. The remaining content from the GoVAULT PRD PDF
2. All files from the existing codebase
3. Any additional documentation or requirements

Only after reviewing both the complete requirements and existing implementation can I provide an accurate assessment and continuation plan.
